    <p>At this point, we are comfortable with the idea that we can store <b>data</b> in <b>variables</b>.  We should also be comfortable with the idea that a variable has: <ul><li>A Name</li><li>A Data Type</li><li>A Value</li></ul> </p>
    <p>So, lets imagine that we want to store the names of pupils in a class. Our first approach may be to store each pupil name in a variable.</p>
    <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/10d1f92f11?runOption=run" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>However, this is going to lead us to a number of questions, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How many pupils are there in the class?</li>  
        <li>How many variables do I need to declare?</li>
        <li>What happens if pupils join or leave the class?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what we need is a flexible way to store pupil names.  A way that will allow us to add or remove names if pupils join or leave the class.  This is what <b>lists</b> provide. </p>
    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <p>A <b>Python List</b> allows us to create a list of variables.  We can then think of this list as either a single variable (with a data type of list) or as a collection of variables (with assorted data types).</p>
    <p>Just like any variable, we need to declare a list before we use it.</p>
    <p>Lists can be declared in the following syntaxt:</p>

    <h1>List Indexes</h1>
    <p>
        Once we have declared our list, we can either treat the list as a single variable, or access individual items within the last.
        To access a single item, we use the [ ] operator.  Between the [ ], we place the position of the item we want to access.

        It is important to note that lists start counting at 0. The first item is [0].

        We can use <code>[ ]</code> to either read or write to the list.

     <h1>Adding Items.</h1>
     <p>We have seen that we are able to initialise a list using code similar to:

       <p><code>myList = ['Albert', 'Brian', 'Charles']</code></p>

     We can also add or remove items to lists while the program is running.  We can use the <code>append()</code> function to add an item to the end of a list.  This is often used in collecting data from the user.
     </p>

     <p>The <code>append()</code> function will place the new item at the end of the list.  We can also use the <code>insert()</code> function to place a new item at any position in the list.</p>
