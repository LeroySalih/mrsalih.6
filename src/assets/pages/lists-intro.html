      <h2>Background.</h2>
      <div>
        At this point, we are comfortable with the idea that we can store <b>data</b> in <b>variables</b>.  We should also be comfortable with the idea that a variable has: <ul><li>A Name</li><li>A Data Type</li><li>A Value</li></ul> 
      </div>
      
      <div
      >So, lets imagine that we want to store the names of pupils in a class. Our first approach may be to store each pupil name in a variable.

      </div>

      </div>
      
      <div>
        However, this is going to lead us to a number of questions, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>How many pupils are there in the class?</li>  
          <li>How many variables do I need to declare?</li>
          <li>What happens if pupils join or leave the class?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        So, what we need is a flexible way to store pupil names.  A way that will allow us to add or remove names if pupils join or leave the class.  This is what <b>lists</b> provide. 
      </div>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <div>A <b>Python List</b> allows us to create a list of variables.  We can then think of this list as either a single variable (with a data type of list) or as a collection of variables (with assorted data types).</div>
      <div>Just like any variable, we need to declare a list before we use it.</div>
      <div>Lists can be declared in the following syntaxt:</div>

      <div>

      </div>
      <h2>List Indexes</h2>
      <div>
        Once we have declared our list, we can either treat the list as a single variable, or access individual items within the last.
        To access a single item, we use the [ ] operator.  Between the [ ], we place the position of the item we want to access.

        It is important to note that lists start counting at 0. The first item is [0].

        We can use [ ] to either read or write to the list.

      </div>
      <h2>Adding Items.</h2>
      <div>We have seen that we are able to initialise a list using code similar to:

        <p><code>myList = ['Albert', 'Brian', 'Charles']</code></p>

      We can also add or remove items to lists while the program is running.  We can use the <code>append()</code> function to add an item to the end of a list.  This is often used in collecting data from the user.
      </div>

      </div>


      <div>The <code>append()</code> function will place the new item at the end of the list.  We can also use the <code>insert()</code> function to place a new item at any position in the list.</div>

      <h2>Removing Items</h2>
      <div>
        When we need to remove an item from the list, we have 4 options.  
        <ul>
          <li><code>pop()</code> We can call pop() to remove the last item of the list.</li>
          <li><code>remove()</code> We can call remove() remove a specific item from the list.</li>
          <li><code>del</code> We can use del to remove a specific position from the list</li>
          <li><code>clear</code> Will remove all the items from the list.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>List Functions</h2>
      <div>
        Being able to store  list of variables is the start of what makes lists usful.  However, what really gives them their power are their <b>Functions</b>
      </div>
      <div>As you know, a function is a small piece of code that can be executed many times and often gives us a reult.</div>
      <div>There are a number of <b>List Functions</b> that we can use in our code to make our life far easier.</div>
      <div>
        Some examples of these functions are: <ul>
          <li>sort() - </li>
          <li>len () - This will give us the number of items in a list.</li>
          <li>count() - </li>

        </ul>
