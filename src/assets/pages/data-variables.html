      <h2>Background.</h2>
      <div>
        A computer program is a combination of <b>COMMANDS</b> and <B>DATA</B>.  Data is the information that flows around the computer program,  while COMMANDS are used to <b>input</b>input, <b>output</b> and <b>process</b> the data.
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        When we need to remember a value, we can ask the computer to store the value in memory.  A computer will store the value in a <b>Variable</b>.  
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        A variable can be thought of as a box in computer memory. When the computer needs to remember a value, the value is placed in the box.  The value can be retrieved from the box at a later time by the computer.
      </div>
      <div>Before we can use a variable, we must:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tell the computer that it needs to reserve a box.  This is called <b>"declaring"</b> the variable.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the variable has been declared, it must have a value placed in it.  This is called <b>"Initialising"</b> the variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the variable has been declared and initialised, it can be <b>"used"</b> by the commands of the program. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      Python uses a single line of code to declare and initialise a variable (see examples below).  In the code below, we declare  4 variables (TeacherName, TeacherAge, TeacherWeightKgs and TeacherIsMale) and initialise them with a number of values.
    </div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      Then, using the <code>print</code> command, we display the variables to the screen.
    </div>

      <h2>Properties of Variables</h2>
      <div>
        We have said that we can think of a variable as a box, where we store data.  We must also be aware of the properties of a variable.  All variables have the following properties: 
        <ul>
          <li>A Name.</li>
          <li>A Data Type.</li>
          <li>A Value.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Variable Names</h3>
      <div>
        The <b>Name</b> of the variable is used to identify which variable we want to use in our program.  A program may have 1, 10 or a 1,000,000 variables, so it is important to be able to identify specific variables when we want to use them in calculations.  Each programming language has different rules for what you can call a variable.  In python, a variable name:
        <ul>
          <li>Can not contain a space or punctuation character (other than an underscore '_')</li>
          <li>Can not start with a number</li>
        </ul>
        Also, variable names should be <b>Meaningful</b>.  This means that you should be able to understand the purpose of a variable from its name.
      </div>

      </div>
    
      
      <h3>Variable Data Types</h3>
      <div>
          The Data Type of a variable determines which values a variable can hold.  Although there are many Data Types, the main ones are:
          <ul>
            <li><b>integer</b> - can hold any whole number</li>
            <li><b>real</b> or <b>float</b> - can hold any decimal number</li>
            <li><b>string</b> - can hold any sequence of characters</li>
            <li><b>boolean</b> - can hold either True or False</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        Some programming languages require to declare the data type at the same time as declaring the variable name.  However, python will guess the Data Type of a variable based on the value.  Also, the data type can change if the value in the variable changes.
      </div>
      <div>
        We can use the <code>type</code> command to check the Data Type of a variable.
      </div>
      <div>
        In the example below, we can see that the data type of <code>TestVariable</code> changes each time we have assigned a new value.
        <ul>
          <li>Values in Quotes ('' or "") are automatically <code>string</code>.</li>
          <li>Whole numbers are  automatically <code>integers</code>.</li>
          <li>Decimal numbers are automatically <code>float</code> or <code>real</code>.</li>
          <li>True or False values are automatically <code>boolean</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
